      "|1178162   |8226316 |2013-10-21|884407     |Laurent      |Communication with Islam and his brother was good. However, we arrived at their house and the toilet was completely plugged up and full of excrements. At this point, we were totally disgusted. We went out to town, which by train takes about 15mn plus 10mn walk to the station. We managed to speak with Islam brother. He fixed the problem when we came back by 4pm.   The house is basic with thin walls and the bedrooms are minimum comfort. We were supposed to be on the basement, which I really don't recommend. Bad smell and the bed is for one person rather than two. We stayed in the upper room, as we though we were there. Nobody in the house except from one guest staying also in the upper level.   Islam sent us an email during our stay, which we couldn't see as we didn't have a computer with us or the use of our smartphone. However, he told us to stay in the basement while no booking was made for the upper room. Not sure why he wanted us to stay in the basement where the room and bed were very basic, when he could have told us to stay in the room upstairs!  The fact that the owner wasn't there made it a strange feeling. The back door in the kitchen were not locked at all, while our luggage was in the house. We didn't got told at all. We had to put a bar across to kinda off close the sliding door but felt very unsafe as anybody could have walking in easily or made their way in.  All in all, things went fine by the end but we definitely not recommend the place unless the owner is there. If you are looking for a cheap place to stay and don't mind of those inconvenience, then you will like it.  A part from that Boston is a great city and we had fun!|positive |\n",

We loved the convenience of the location near the airport, as we weren't familiar with Boston, and landed late at night, so we didn't want to have to travel far or follow complicated directions to find the place. Although we never had any face-to-face contact with Izzy or anyone else in the home during our brief overnight stay, we felt comfortable there. Although we were assured that the neighborhood was safe, we were still feeling a bit on edge walking late at night from the Airport \"T\" station. Nonetheless, we made our way there without incident, and had a restful night of sleep before launching out the next day. Thanks, Izzy!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |positive |\n",

Things went quite smoothly upon arrival as per the detailed instructions that were left.   We managed to get the key from the lock box easily which was nice because it provided flexibility for whatever time we arrived. This place is extremely close to the airport. I've never stayed next door to the airport before. Less than a 5 min ride to Airport Station which was then a 5 min walk.  Place had everything. Felt very homely like staying at a friends. Location was amazing!! East Boston has some hidden gem restaurants and proximity to Airport subway station was key. No complaints about the room or bathroom.

We chose the most expensive room in the house because we were meant to be the only ones on the bottom floor, and we were told we would get a computer... Well we had his assistant sleep right outside our door and we did not have a computer.  On top of that, every room had a TV but ours, and the tv in the living room did not get basic channels which frustrated us.   The house was a mess up until the day we left, because izzy was apparently coming home that day, so his assistant decided to clean up. It was a totally different house upon checkout.  His assistant was lovely, just not much help... As far as The location goes, it is convenient to downtown and the airport, and has local shops and restaurants close by.  We did enjoy our stay overall there was just more than enough frustrating elements..                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |positive |\n",

The flat is really close to the airport, and only a small hop into the heart of Boston, it was very convenient for us! :)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |positive |\n",

There was a sign that said 'in the process of renovations'.   I think the second floor might be a little noisy some evenings, with 3 rooms up there. The one lower/ground floor room was quieter, but keep in mind not easily accessible with narrow winding stairs. Futon style bed.     The host was prompt with text message responses to questions about parking.  Parking in the neighborhood mid-day was easy but all streets were filled with parked/double parked cars by 5pm.

This is a great location that is a short walk to the airport shuttle.  The room is in the basement and it gets hot during the day.  The house has A/C upstairs, but this does not reach the basement room so it was pretty hot.  The neighborhood a little bit ethnic, which I didn't mind, but if this makes you uncomfortable you might want to look elsewhere.  I felt safe, and the lockbox system is secure.    For a traveler like myself who had an early flight out of Logan, this was the cost effective option.  Can't beat the price for a location so close to the airport!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |positive |\n",

      "|1178162   |16221436|2014-07-23|2420725    |Jessica      |Unfortunately, we can't agree with the many positive reviews. The house was easy to find and just a short 7 minute walk from the T-Station \"Airport\", but not what I would describe as clean. After arrival I started to clean a bit. E.g. the hob in the spacious kitchen, which you can use including all the inventory(and what's perfect for a nice breakfast), was kind of greasy and that didn't change during our three day stay. Sure this isn't a hotel and the guests are responsible for cleanliness as well, but the host takes a cleaning fee. If they would clean the house on a regular basis, it would be a nice accommodation, as we really liked the premises. Our basement room had a little fridge, a mirror, a tv and a luggage stand what we appreciated. Somehow we missed the \"warm welcome\" feeling  we experienced at other airbnb locations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |positive |\n",
